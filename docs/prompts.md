## Types

### Completion Prompts

- Suitable for ==**single-turn tasks**== where the model generates a response based on a single input prompt
- Conversation context/history and role seggregation is not essential
- Works well for content generation, summarization, question-answering etc.

### Chat Prompts

- Designed for ==**multi-turn conversations**== with multiple roles (user, assistant, system etc.)
    - **System prompt** - indicates what task the AI is performing and what tone it should use
    - **User prompt** - the prompt from user that the AI should reply to
- Maintains conversation context (see [context window](../concepts/#cust-id-genai-terminology)) by processing the entire conversation history
- Ideal for chatbot applications and tasks requiring back-and-forth interactions

## Prompting Guidelines
### Structure
- Break down large prompts into steps
    - Use **[delimiters](#cust-id-delimiters-prompt)** for organizing the prompt

        ??? tip "Stop Sequences"
            - Can be used to signal the end of an example in ==**[few-shot prompting](#cust-id-few-shot)**== 
            - Helps to structure the input data for the model
            - Triple backticks, quotes, double hashtags etc.

    - Break large prompts into "sub-prompts" if needed
- **Context**: Brief introduction or background information
    - Include topic, industry/field, relevant links, keywords, datasets, text chunks etc.
    - Constraints or restrictions
- **Persona**: Role or expertise/profession the prompt should use
    - Use phrases such as `Act as`, `Your role is to`, `Imagine you are` etc.
    - Add relevant details such as field of work, company name, time period, region etc.
- **Goal/Intent**: Define what the prompt should do
    - Describe objective
        - Use ==**action verbs**== such as `Analyze`, `Generate`, `Simplify`, `Summarize` etc.
    - Mention any focus areas using phrases such as `Focus on` etc.

    - **Other Specs**: 
        - Specify constraints (Number of words, points, lines, paragraphs etc.): 
            - Summarize using x bullet points, numbered lists etc.
            - Make your response as short as possible.
        - Specify length of output

- **Validate**: Ask for proof for reducing hallucinations  and fabricated responses
    - Ask model to find relevant information, then answer the question based on the relevant information
    - Provide relevant sources and citations

??? tip "Code chunks in Prompts"
    Include code chunks in a prompt by enclosing them in single backticks followed by the name of the language:
    ```
    Some text
    `python
    some python code
    `
    More text
    ```

### Tactics[^1]
<p id="cust-id-delimiters-prompt"></p>
- **Tactic 1: Use delimiters**
    - Triple Quotes: `"""`
    - Triple backticks: ` ``` `
    - Triple dashes: `---`
    - Angle brackets: `<>`
    - XML tags: `\<tag>\</tag>`

    ??? abstract "Sample"
        ```
        text = f"""
        A paragraph of text
        """

        prompt = f"""
        Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks into a single sentence.
        ```{text}``` 
        """
        ```

- **Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output in a specified format**
    - JSON, HTML etc.
    - Markdown with structured sections and headings
        
    ??? abstract "Sample"
        ```
        # Example 1a - Simple JSON with specified keys
        prompt = f"""
        Generate a list of three bollywood movies along with their director and year of release. 

        Provide them in JSON format with the following keys:

        """
        ```

        ```
        # Example 1b - Simple JSON with example
        prompt = f"""

    ??? abstract "Sample"
        ```
        prompt = f"""
        Your task is to determine if the student's solution is correct or not.
        To solve the problem do the following:
        - First, work out your own solution to the problem. 
        - Then compare your solution to the student's solution and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until you have done the problem yourself.

        Use the following format:
        Question:
        - question here
        Student's solution:
        - student's solution here
        Actual solution:
        - steps to work out the solution and your solution here
        Is the student's solution the same as actual solution just calculated:

        - Lead actor charges $100 / episode
        - Lead actress charges $90 / episode
        - I negotiated a contract for character actors that will cost me a flat $1K for the first 10 character actors for the entire show, and an additional $25 per additional character actor / episode
        What is the total amount I need to spend on the actors as a function of the number of episodes. Assume that I end up using a total of 12 character actors per episode.

        Student's solution:
        Let x be the number of episodes.
        Costs:
        1. Lead actor charges: 100x
        2. Lead actress charges: 90x
        3. Character actor charges: 1,000 + 300x
        Total cost: 100x + 90x + 1,000 + 300x = 490x + 1,000

        Actual solution:
